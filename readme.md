# HTMX Crash Course

This is the code from my HTMX [crash course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UvA7zvwsmg). It uses a Node/Express server. All of the HTMX is in the `/public` .html files.

There are several examples:

- `request.html`: Simple example of how to trigger events, make requests, set targets, etc
- `temperature.html`: Simple temperature converter
- `polling.html`: Example of polling (making a request every x seconds) using a mock weather api
- `search.html`: A contact search widget
- `validation.html`: Inline validation example
- `profile.html`: Simple profile click-to-edit

## Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Visit the html page (eg. http://localhost:3000/search.html)
